If you're good at something, never do it for free.

Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? 
I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one 
if I caught it! You know, I just...DO things.

Do you want to know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. 
You can’t savor all the… little emotions...you see, 
in their last moments, people show you who they really are. 
So in a way, I know your friends better than you ever did. 
Would you like to know which of them were cowards?
